 ***NOTE: A ZERO PIVOT WARNING (IF THE *MODEL  CHANGE OPTION WAS USED) MIGHT

 ***NOTE: FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SHELL ELEMENT AND A BRICK ELEMENT SHARE A COMMON 
          NODE, AND THE SHELL ELEMENT IS REMOVED, THE BENDING STIFFNESS AT THE 
          NODE WOULD BE SET TO ZERO BUT THE NODE WOULD STILL BE ACTIVE SINCE 
          THE BRICK ELEMENT IS STILL PART OF THE MODEL.  ONE POSSIBLE FIX IN
